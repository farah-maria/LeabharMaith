Brandon, / have you hardened? And your heart?\") that we almost expect to hear the response.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeftly and faithfully rendered in English by Paddy Bushe, these selected poems are, among other things, an invitation to \"stop Dead still Without spilling a drop / From the jug of your heart ...\" - the kind of invitation few of us can afford to pass up on.",

To do so he must locate an alternate Ireland named Camland, the existence of which is proven when he discovers a literary journal whose contents mirror his own past. With proof of his wild theories, Darren is sure academic fame is imminent. But for this he is willing to sacrifice not just his sanity and physical safety, but also his relationships with the ones who love him most.\r\n\r\nIn breathless prose, Declan Toohey weaves a contemporary yarn of academic intrigue and youthful irreverence, sexual fluidity and neurodiversity. Experimental and trippy, hilarious and compassionate, Perpetual Comedown is a riotous reckoning of the definition of the self.",

        "blurb": "Ireland in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was not a good place to be a woman. Among the wave of emigrants from Ireland to North America were many, many young women who travelled on their own, hoping for a better life. Some lived lives of quiet industry and piety. Others quickly found themselves in trouble – bad trouble, and on an astonishing scale.\r\n\r\nElaine Farrell and Leanne McCormick, creators of the celebrated ‘Bad Bridget’ podcast, have unearthed a world in which Irish women actually outnumbered Irish men in prison, in which you could get locked up for ‘stubbornness’, and in which a serial killer called Lizzie Halliday was described by the New York Times as ‘the worst woman on earth’. They reveal the social forces that bred this mayhem and dysfunction, through stories that are brilliantly strange, sometimes funny, and often moving. From sex workers and thieves to kidnappers and killers, these Bridgets are young women who have gone from the frying pan of their impoverished homeland to the fire of vast North American cities.\r\n\r\nBad Bridget is a masterpiece of social history and true crime, showing us a fascinating and previously unexplored world.",
