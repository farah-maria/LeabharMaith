# Leabhar Maith

## Introduction
  
<br>    
  
This is a README for an e-commerce website for a hypothetical business called 'Leabhar Maith', meaning 'good book' in Irish. 
Leabhar Maith is a business to customer (B2C) e-commerce site, selling literary products to the user, namely books written in English and Irish by Irish authors. The deliverables will expand in future to include journals, paperweights and stationary with an Irish literary theme. Customers sign up to create an online account and pay via single payments using Stripe. 

Features of this business-focused website include a shopping cart, a catalogue of products that is curated and updated quarterly and is searchable by author or title, an online payment system that can save the customer’s preferred mode of payment, a quarterly email newsletter sign-up, and a featured product every season from a different boutique manufacturer, which comes free with no extra postage fee when the customer spends €70. 

The site was developed using Python in the Django framework and styled using CSS and Bootstrap. ElephantSQL is used for the database and Heroku for deployment. 

'Leabhar Maith' means 'good book' in Irish.

## User Experience, Research and Design

I looked at a range of online bookshops, most of which constituted the online presence of a physical shop or chain of shops, such as Waterstones (https://www.waterstones.com/), Easons (https://www.easons.com/) or my local favourite, Vibes and Scribes (https://www.vibesandscribes.ie/). The book industry in Ireland is one where smaller, one-off independent bookshops do not necessarily have a web presence at all, such as my closest bookshop in East Cork, Midleton Books (it does have a Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/midletonbooks/). On the other hand, the Book Depository (owned by Amazon) offers free delivery in Ireland, practically every book going, but no physical shop at all (https://www.bookdepository.com/).

Given the impersonal e-commerce feel of many online bookshops, even those that are linked to a physical shop well grounded in a local area, such as Vibes & Scribes, I wanted to create an alternative that brings a personal feel to online book shopping. Rather like a friendly and knowledgable bookshop owner or assistant, Leabhar Maith offers a curated selection of up to eight books per quarter, recommended by the site owner. 

The selection changes every four months, with the seasons, so that there is a Spring selection of books, a Summer collection, and so on, bringing a dash of fashion-industry excitement to the concept of new collections being revealed, as well as an ancient feel of Ireland’s connection with the land. Past selections and the books in them can still be accessed and purchased by the site user. There's also the feeling of a book-club to the site, a little like the Guardian bookshop, which stocks the books featured in the Guardian and has a book-club subscription. (Subscriptions would be an obvious idea for a future feature of this business). 

There is a newsletter sign-up that connects the user with new offers and reviews, some of which will eventually be written by selected Leabhar Maith readers. 

Readers are 'at home' with Leabhar Maith, and can contribThe curation of groups of books, however, encourages buying multiple books and there is a discount on larger purchases. 

While the shop is about familiarity and friendliness rather than anonymity, users may make purchases in guest-mode if they don't want to sign up to emails or have their details saved.

Despite being in a team of... one... I used an Agile approach to designing, planning and developing the site. Well, actually, I did get together with another software engineering student from a software testing course, and we pretended we were in a work-place team for the testing of features. We communicated via the ‘issues’ comments on the GitHub project for Leabhar Maith, and this can be seen on the details for each issue/ user-story/ feature-needed-docket. He taught me some of the terminology used for software testing, and we use this in the comments, which was great! (Thank you, Joey!)

The first step was to gather the  user stories and record them using  GitHub project tools. An MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was then designed around the requirements that most directly met the needs of each user story.
